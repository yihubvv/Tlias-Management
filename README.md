# Preface
This is an online project witha given front page. I developed the rear-end part.

This system manages departments, status of classes and student, keeps in track of employees and their genders.

#How to start:

1. find nginx.exe in nginx-1.22.0-web, double click

3. in intellij, open and run the web-ai-project2, make sure your localhost:8080 and 90 are unoccupied by other apps.
   
4. Go to localhost:90 and you can operate on things.
   
The managers have the right to delete, edit, add employees and so on.
